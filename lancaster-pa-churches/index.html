          The Spirit of God has been moving and continues to move throughout the Nation and the 
          World in unparalleled ways. This, however, does <strong>not</strong> mean the Church is free of 
          persecution, encroachment of directly opposing religions, or even slaughter. 
          <br>
          <br>
          What does this mean for us? The <strong>last thing</strong> we need is internal strife in the 
          Church. <em>(1 Corinthians 1:10)</em> It is time for us to <strong>unite</strong> as Christians 
          <strong>under Christ</strong>, sticking to sound doctrine: that <strong>Jesus is Lord</strong>
          <em>(John 10:30-38)</em>, God is <strong>one God</strong> with 
          <strong>three persons</strong> <em>(1 John 5:7)</em>, salvation is <strong>by grace through faith</strong>
          in Christ <strong>alone</strong> <em>(John 14:6)</em>, and the Bible is <strong>inerrant</strong>
          and <strong>infallible</strong> <em>(2 Timothy 3:16)</em>. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <br>
        Knowing there are so many Christians across the globe who believe these things but may 
        disagree on secondary issues, I sought out to unite true believers in Christ 
        and Bible-believing Churches so we can work together to <strong>advance</strong> the knowledge 
        of the Gospel of Jesus Christ(Matthew 28:19-20) and <strong>combat</strong> the spiritual forces 
        of evil in this dark world (Ephesians 6:12). And by God’s grace, this vision 
        and project has gotten to this point today.
